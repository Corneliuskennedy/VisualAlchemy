# Critical Conversion Optimization - Service Pages
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGHEST - Livelihood Depends On This  
**Target:** Service Detail Pages (Money Pages)  
**Goal:** +30-50% conversion rate increase

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters Most

**Service detail pages are where purchasing decisions are made:**
- `/services/crm-buildouts`
- `/services/lead-generation`
- `/services/hiring-systems`
- `/services/ai-automation-amsterdam`
- `/services/ai-service-fulfillment`
- `/services/startup-kickoff-lab`
- `/services/project-management`
- `/services/sops-consulting`

**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Hero spacing inconsistent (`py-16 md:py-20` vs `py-32 md:py-40`)
- ❌ CTAs are generic ("Book CRM Analysis" vs value-focused)
- ❌ No social proof/testimonials on service pages
- ❌ No clear ROI/value proposition in hero
- ❌ No urgency/scarcity elements
- ❌ Cal.com booking not prominent enough
- ❌ Missing trust signals (guarantees, results)
