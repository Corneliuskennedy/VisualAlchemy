        q1: {
          question: "What is a process audit?",
          answer: "A comprehensive analysis of your business operations to identify automation opportunities that can eliminate 40-70% of manual work. We provide you with a detailed roadmap of high-ROI improvements and implementation strategies."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "How much does the process audit cost?",
          answer: "The initial process audit is completely free. We guarantee you'll find at least €15,000 in annual automation savings, or we don't move forward with any paid engagement."
        },
        q3: {
          question: "What happens after the process audit?",
          answer: "You'll receive a detailed automation roadmap and can choose to implement it yourself or have us build and implement your highest-ROI opportunities as fixed-price projects."
        },
        q4: {
          question: "Why start with a process audit instead of jumping straight into automation?",
          answer: "Most businesses waste money automating the wrong things. Our process audit ensures we understand your unique challenges and identify the highest-ROI opportunities first, saving you time and money."
        },
        q5: {
          question: "Do I have to work with you afterwards?",
          answer: "Absolutely not. Our primary goal is to empower your team. The action plan they create is yours to implement however you choose. No obligations, ever."
        },
        q6: {
          question: "How long does the process audit take?",
          answer: "The initial process audit typically takes 2-3 hours, conducted in a single session. We can also split it into multiple shorter sessions if needed to fit your schedule."
        },
        q7: {
          question: "Can the process audit be done remotely?",
          answer: "Yes, we conduct process audits both in-person and remotely via video conference. Both formats deliver the same thorough analysis and strategic recommendations."
        },
        q8: {
          question: "What if you don't find €15,000 in improvements?",
          answer: "If we don't identify at least €15,000 in annual automation savings during the process audit, we don't move forward with any paid engagement. No obligations, no costs."
        },
        q9: {
          question: "What industries do you work with?",
          answer: "We work with B2B companies across all industries. Our process mapping methodology is universal and adapts to any business model."
        },
        q10: {
          question: "How quickly will I see results?",
          answer: "After the process audit, you'll have a clear roadmap of automation opportunities with prioritized quick wins. Implementation timelines vary, but most businesses see significant improvements within 2-4 weeks of starting implementation."
        },
        q11: {
          question: "How does Octomatic ensure GDPR compliance?",
          answer: "We build our automation solutions with a 'privacy-by-design' approach, ensuring that data protection is a core part of the architecture.

          question: "What makes Octomatic's lead generation systems different?",
          answer: "Our lead generation systems combine outbound strategies with marketing automation to create a consistent flow of qualified leads. We don't just set up tools - we design comprehensive systems that qualify leads based on your ideal customer profile, nurture them through automated sequences, and deliver them to your sales team at exactly the right moment.",
          questionNL: "Wat maakt de lead generatie systemen van Octomatic anders?",

We zetten niet alleen tools op - we ontwerpen uitgebreide systemen die leads kwalificeren op basis van uw ideale klantprofiel, ze nurteren via geautomatiseerde sequences, en ze op precies het juiste moment aan uw sales team leveren."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "How quickly will I see results from a lead generation system?",
          answer: "Most clients see their first qualified leads within 2-4 weeks of implementation. However, the system continues to improve over time as we gather data and refine targeting and messaging. By month three, you can expect a consistent and predictable flow of qualified opportunities.",
          questionNL: "Hoe snel zie ik resultaten van een lead generatie systeem?",
          answerNL: "De meeste klanten zien hun eerste gekwalificeerde leads binnen 2-4 weken na implementatie. Het systeem blijft echter verbeteren naarmate we data verzamelen en targeting en messaging verfijnen. Tegen maand drie kunt u een consistente en voorspelbare stroom van gekwalificeerde kansen verwachten."

        q3: {
          question: "What platforms and tools do you use for lead generation?",
          answer: "We customize the tech stack based on your specific needs and target audience, but commonly utilize LinkedIn, email automation platforms, CRM systems like HubSpot or Pipedrive, and various intent data tools. The key is how we integrate these tools into a seamless system that requires minimal manual intervention.",

        q1: {
          question: "Wat is een value stream mapping workshop?",
          answer: "Een intensieve sessie van 4 uur waarin we uw meest kritieke end-to-end proces in kaart brengen, verborgen verspilling identificeren en duidelijke kansen voor hoog-ROI automatisering definiëren."
        },
        q2: {
          question: "Hoeveel kost de workshop?",
          answer: "De workshop kost €1.497 als vaste prijs investering. We garanderen dat u minimaal €15.000 aan jaarlijkse verbeteringen vindt, anders is de workshop volledig gratis."
        },
        q3: {
          question: "Wat gebeurt er na de workshop?",
          answer: "U ontvangt een gedetailleerde automatisering roadmap en kunt kiezen om deze zelf te implementeren of ons uw eerste grote winst te laten bouwen als een vaste prijs project."
        },
        q4: {
          question: "Waarom beginnen met een workshop in plaats van direct te automatiseren?",
          answer: "De meeste bedrijven verspillen geld door de verkeerde dingen te automatiseren. Onze workshop zorgt ervoor dat we uw unieke uitdagingen begrijpen en eerst de hoogste-ROI kansen identificeren."
        },
        q5: {
          question: "Moet ik daarna met jullie werken?",
          answer: "Absoluut niet. Ons primaire doel is om uw team te versterken. Het actieplan dat zij creëren is van u om te implementeren zoals u kiest. Geen verplichtingen, ooit."
        },
        q6: {
          question: "Hoe lang duurt de workshop?",
          answer: "De workshop duurt precies 4 uur, meestal gepland in één sessie. We kunnen het ook splitsen in twee sessies van 2 uur indien nodig."
        },
        q7: {
          question: "Kan de workshop op afstand worden gedaan?",
          answer: "Ja, we voeren workshops zowel persoonlijk als op afstand uit via videoconferentie. Beide formaten leveren dezelfde resultaten en waarde."
        },
        q8: {
          question: "Wat als u geen €15.000 aan verbeteringen vindt?",
          answer: "Als we tijdens de workshop niet minimaal €15.000 aan jaarlijkse verbeteringen identificeren, is de hele workshop volledig gratis. Geen vragen gesteld."
        },
        q9: {
          question: "Met welke industrieën werkt u samen?",
          answer: "We werken samen met B2B bedrijven in alle industrieën. Onze proces mapping methodologie is universeel en past zich aan aan elk bedrijfsmodel."
        },
        q10: {
          question: "Hoe snel zie ik resultaten?",
          answer: "Uw team verlaat de 4-uur durende sessie met nieuwe vaardigheden en een gedefinieerde \"eerste winst.\" Veel teams zijn zo geënergiseerd dat ze binnen een week beginnen met het implementeren van veranderingen."
