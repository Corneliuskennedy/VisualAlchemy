    question: "What does 'unlimited' mean?",
    answer: "You can submit unlimited requests for adjustments, refinements, and improvements. Our average turnaround is 2-4 business days, with complex integrations taking up to 5+ working days. We'll always provide clear timeline estimates and work continuously to ensure you're never blocked."
  },
  {
    question: "How much more cost-effective is this?",
    answer: "Compared to a full-time COO (€9,000+/month after taxes and benefits), our service costs approximately 30% of an in-house hire and 70% of a specialist agency. You get access to our expertise and systems with the flexibility to pause or cancel anytime."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know which tier is right for me?",
    answer: "We recommend starting with the monthly plan for access to core services with full flexibility. For committed growth and evolution, consider the quarterly plan. Still unsure? Let's have a consultation to discuss your unique needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What's your guarantee?",
    answer: "If you're not 100% satisfied with our completed services, we'll continue working on your system for free until it meets the agreed-upon win condition and quality standards, and you're happy with the results."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when we stop?",
    answer: "All systems are built in your environment, on your accounts, so they remain yours when we're done, with no dependencies on us. You retain full ownership and control."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I submit a request?",
    answer: "After onboarding, you'll get access to your personal ClickUp board for project tracking and new requests. We provide a tutorial video to get you started and are available to help with any issues."
  },
  {
    question: "How will we stay in touch?",
    answer: "We communicate through ClickUp and Slack. Weekly, you can choose your preferred contact method (email, video call, or phone call) via a Monday form. We provide high flexibility to ensure you're always in control."
  },
  {
    question: "Why not hire a COO instead?",
    answer: "Hiring a COO in the Netherlands is time-consuming, expensive, and comes with no guarantees. We offer customized automation systems and expert help with the flexibility to adjust or end the partnership anytime."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the payment process?",
    answer: "Payment is processed through Stripe, where you can set up a recurring subscription that can be easily paused or cancelled at any time."
  },
  {
    question: "What does '100% satisfied' mean?",
    answer: "Through a clear feedback loop, you can request changes or adjustments. We'll refine your systems until they meet agreed-upon win conditions and are fully functional. Larger projects may have defined scope and timeframes."
